<HR>
OTT needs developers!  The main tasks right now are:

<UL>
<LI>Port OTT to the remaining Oberon platforms: V4, Sys3, 
POW, and Native.</LI>
<LI>Develop an automatic converter utility to port
source code between O2 and ComponentPascal.  The converter
that comes with BBox is not sufficient.</LI>
<LI>Develop a command-line interface console window in BBox where
In waits for input.  Eg. Out.String("Enter your name"); In.String(buf);</LI>
</UL>
