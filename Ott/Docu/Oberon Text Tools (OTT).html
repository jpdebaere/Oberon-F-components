<H1>Oberon Text Tools (OTT)</H1>
<HR>


<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
OTT is a portable text i/o library for Oberon environments.  It provides
a stable, scalable API for manipulation of plaintext (streams of CHARs).
<P>
<H3>a) Goals</H3>
<UL>
<LI><i>Simplicity</i>.  OTT is a scalable API that supports simple text i/o with
 a minimum of fuss, and complex i/o using multiple readers and
 writers.</LI>
<LI><I>Portability</I>.  OTT applications are intended to be portable to all
  OTT supported Oberon environments.</LI>
<LI><I>Reliability</I>.  OTT is intended to become a de-factor standard for
 I/O in Oberon systems.
</UL>
OTT is not intended to support formatted text (font, colours, etc).  UNICODE
support may be added later.  Binary data streams (8-bit byte streams) are supported
by the lowest layer APIs in OTT.
<P>

<H3>b) OTT and OOC</H3>
OTT is based on the I/O sub-system of the OOC library and uses the channel/rider
concept to support i/o to a variety of sources and destinations (texts, files, etc).  A 
channel is a connection to some data location (i.e. a source or sink for data),
and presents the data as a stream of bytes.  Channels export Reader and Writer
objects that can be used to access or modify the data in the channel.  Since all
Channel, Reader, and Writer types are derived from base abstract types, programs
can be written to operate on any type of channel.
<P>
<H3>c) Three levels of APIs</H3>
OTT provides APIs with increasing flexibility:
<UL>
<LI> OttIn and OttOut modules provide simple i/o to any channel.</LI>
<LI> The TextRider module provides more flexible scanning and formatting support, and
  supports converting native Oberon data types to and from plaintext.
  Alternately, the module Tokenizer provides basic string parsing
  similar to C's strtok() function.
</LI>
<LI> The lowest level modules (eg. Files) provide byte-level access and multiple readers and writers.</L1>
</UL>
<P>

<H3>d) OTT Channels</H3>
The types of channels supported are system-dependent.  All OTT implementations offer Files.  
OTT on full "Oberon systems" such as Black Box or V4 will offer Texts (a channel that
connects to the native Text object) and Log.
<P>
Since the channel types are not portable, it is recommended to separate the creation
of channels from their use, which should be as OttChannel objects, or using OttTextRider.

<HR>
<H2>2. Version Information</H2>

The current version of OTT is 0.1.  This is the first release of OTT. It's based on OO2C-1.3.8.  
<P>
It supports the following Oberon environments:
<UL>
<LI>BlackBox version 1.3 (also known as Oberon/F)</LI>
</UL>
Other versions (OO2C, V4, Sys3, etc) are to follow.
<HR>

<H2>3. Documentation</H2>
OTT includes the following OOC library modules:
<UL>
<LI>Ascii CharClass Strings ConvTypes LRealConv IntConv IntStr</LI>
<LI>Channel Texts Files Log TextRider In Out</LI>
</UL>
Note.  The OTT modules add an "Ott" prefix to the filename.  For example, "OttAscii" 
corresponds to the OOC module "Ascii".
<P>
Please refer to the [<A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20000305042311/http://www.uni-kl.de/OOC/OOCref/OOCref_toc.html">on-line documentation</A>] [* <A HREF="http://ooc.sourceforge.net/OOCref/OOCref_toc.html">latest revision here</A>] 
of the OOC library for the module definitions and a thorough documentation of the APIs.
<P>
Differences between OTT and OOC are described <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000305042311/http://home.istar.ca/~ianrae/OTTdiffs.htm">here</b></a>.

<H2>Download</H2>

<P>
<H2>3.  Installation</H2>
OTT is distributed as source code.  Each Oberon environment
has its own version of OTT.
